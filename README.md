ImagePresenter
==============

Simple tool to show images on a beamer and select images using a TCP command. 
I created this because I often have to show images as a background on theatre plays and wanted to control this using the program I also use for sound cues (Multiplay https://www.audiovisualdevices.com.au/software/multiplay/).
